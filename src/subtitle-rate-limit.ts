/**
 * YouTube answers 429 on the caption endpoint for a whole day once it decides this
 * server asked too often: two such days in September 2026, 24 hours each. Every call
 * then paid for a doomed request, and the canary kept probing on its own schedule,
 * feeding the same quota. This holds a platform's caption path back after a 429, so a
 * limit costs one request per hold instead of hundreds, and the caller hears "do not
 * retry" instead of "wait a few minutes". The strike count is a gauge: two means the
 * platform refused again after the hold with no track in between, which is what a ban
 * looks like.
 *
 * Only subtitle downloads are held back. Metadata kept working through both days, and
 * a hold on it would break `get_video_info` for no reason.
 *
 * The state is process-local and deliberately not in Redis: a restart is a fine moment
 * to find out whether the platform still refuses.
